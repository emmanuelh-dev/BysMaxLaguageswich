  "1": "Open Proteus and create a new schematic.",
  "2": "Select the 'transformer' component from the Proteus library and add it to the schematic.",
  "3": "Configure the input and output voltages in the calculator and copy the values of the primary and secondary winding impedances returned by the calculator.",
  "4": "In the Proteus schematic, double-click on the transformer and in the properties window, paste the values of the primary and secondary winding impedances in the corresponding fields.",
  "5": "Click 'OK' to close the properties window and connect the transformer terminals to your circuit.",
  "6": "Now, the transformer is correctly configured in your Proteus circuit and ready to work.",
  "about": "This calculator allows you to obtain the values necessary to configure the primary and secondary windings of a transformer based on the input and output voltage you want to obtain."
